## Instructions

This landing page uses mostly the pre-defined styling, however I have also added an auto-sliding carousel which updates every 5 seconds for the viewer's pleasure.

The navigation bar at the top of the page is dynamically generated, depending on however many elements with the class 'landing__page' are present. Therefore, the content could be updated or removed in future without the need for a re-write.

If the user wishes to scroll down the page rather than use the navigation bar, there is an event listener attached to each section which will enhance the styling applied to both the text and the corresponding section on the navigation bar. This is to ensure a clear and readable user experience!
